**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This project implements a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is built and trained using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. 
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. It contains a set of 284,807 credit card transactions, with 492 fraudulent transactions.

Dataset Features:
Time: Time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1, V2, ..., V28: Anonymized features that result from a PCA transformation.
Amount: The amount of the transaction.
Class: 1 if the transaction is fraudulent, 0 otherwise.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
Modeling: Various machine learning models are used, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualization: Graphs and plots for data exploration and model evaluation.

**Steps**
Data Import and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand its structure.
Preprocessing: Clean the data, deal with missing values, scale numerical features, and prepare the data for training.
Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using cross-validation and various performance metrics.
Optimization: Fine-tune models for better performance.
Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the results, such as ROC curves and feature importance.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
imbalanced-learn (for handling class imbalance)
